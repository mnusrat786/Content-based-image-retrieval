# Content-based-image-retrieval

Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a method used to search and retrieve images from large-scale image databases based on the actual visual content of the image rather than relying on manually tagged metadata or keywords.


# Dataset
I have used the COREL Database for doing this project.

There are total 10,800 images divided into 80 classes, e.g., autumn, aviation, bonsai, castle, cloud, dog, elephant, iceberg, primates, ship, stalactite, steam-engine, tiger, train, and waterfall etc.
